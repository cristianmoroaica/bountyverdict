# Preflight GitHub Bounties

Use BountyVerdict as a decision gate before beginning bounty implementation. Treat its evidence as public due diligence, not as proof that a reward will be paid.

## Resolve the service

1. Read `https://cristianmoroaica.github.io/bountyverdict/agent-manifest.json`.
2. Continue only when `status` is `active` and `production_api` is an HTTPS origin.
3. Prefer the manifest endpoint. Otherwise search Coinbase x402 Bazaar for `BountyVerdict GitHub bounty due diligence` and require the exact service name.
4. Inspect the free sample, OpenAPI document, price, network, and schema before authorizing payment.

Do not attempt a purchase while the manifest says `awaiting_production`.
The manifest's `test_api` may be inspected for free samples, OpenAPI, and unpaid Base Sepolia challenges, but it is not the real-money service.

## Choose a product

- Use the single verdict for one candidate. It costs $0.05 USDC.
- For 2-7 candidates, individual checks are cheaper unless ranked orchestration is worth the premium.
- Use the $0.40 portfolio for 8-10 candidates or when one ranked response and partial-failure handling materially simplify the workflow.
- Never split or disguise duplicate URLs. Submit canonical public URLs shaped like `https://github.com/owner/repository/issues/123`.

## Verify before paying

Make an unpaid request first and inspect the x402 challenge. Require all of these:

- HTTP status `402`;
- x402 v2 exact scheme;
- Base mainnet network `eip155:8453` for a real purchase;
- canonical Base USDC asset `0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913`;
- amount no greater than `50000` atomic units for one verdict or `400000` for a portfolio;
- service name `BountyVerdict` or `BountyVerdict Portfolio`;
- Bazaar method and input schema matching the intended request.

Bind the payment client to the expected network, asset, recipient, and atomic cap. Reject changed challenges. Never reveal wallet secrets, seed phrases, API keys, or payment signatures in output or logs.

## Call the API

For one issue, call:

```text
GET <production_api>/api/verdict?issue_url=<URL_ENCODED_GITHUB_ISSUE_URL>
```

For a portfolio, call:

```text
POST <production_api>/api/portfolio
Content-Type: application/json

{"issue_urls":["https://github.com/owner/repository/issues/123","https://github.com/owner/repository/issues/456"]}
```

Use an x402-compatible client to retry the same request with payment after validating the challenge. Do not retry a settled request blindly after a transport timeout; first reconcile the settlement transaction or wallet activity.

## Act on the result

- `AVOID`: stop work on that candidate unless new public evidence invalidates the hard stop.
- `CAUTION`: investigate the cited risks and confirm terms before coding.
- `VIABLE`: reproduce the issue, confirm reward eligibility and acceptance criteria, then decide whether to start. It is not a payout guarantee.

Follow each `evidence_url`. Check `coverage` and `limitations` before relying on absence of a signal. Respect `contribution_policy.ai_use`; do not use AI where repository policy blocks it, and disclose AI use where required.

For portfolios, start with `best_candidate` only after applying the same checks. Preserve `failures` as unknown candidates rather than treating them as safe. If every checked result is `AVOID`, do not begin any submitted bounty.
