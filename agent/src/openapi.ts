## Differentiation

BountyVerdict checks up to 300 issue comments, first and newest timeline pages, competing and failed PRs, attempt swarms, issue locks, repository state, explicit maintainer rejection, reward-withdrawal language, and conventional contribution-document paths for AI-work bans or disclosure requirements. Important signals include public evidence URLs and coverage counts.

The portfolio product runs the full check on every submitted candidate, ranks VIABLE before CAUTION before AVOID, recommends the strongest candidate, and reports partial upstream failures.

HarnessVerdict audits the repository's recognized coding-agent instruction surfaces without cloning or executing its code. It reports stale path references, oversized always-loaded context, machine-local paths, malformed skill frontmatter, secret-like material, and client portability across Codex, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, and Cursor. Every result is pinned to the audited commit SHA.

SkillVerdict audits a requested public SKILL.md plus its bounded directory and repository context without execution. It detects high-confidence supply-chain hazards, redacts secret-like values, discloses observed capabilities and external domains, and pins every finding to the exact reviewed commit. LOW_RISK is not a safety guarantee; retain least privilege and inspect coverage before installation.

RunVerdict diagnoses one public GitHub Actions run from exact-attempt job metadata and bounded failed-job logs. It distinguishes primary failures from downstream summary jobs, returns redacted evidence and root-cause families, and recommends whether to fix, investigate, wait, or retry without mutating CI.

## Safety

A VIABLE result means investigate further. It does not guarantee a reward, merge, eligibility, or payment.
