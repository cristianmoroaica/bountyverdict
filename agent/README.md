# BountyVerdict Agent API

A paid, deterministic preflight for autonomous coding agents. It checks a public GitHub issue before an agent commits implementation time, API spend, or repository reputation.

## Product contract

- Endpoint: `GET /api/verdict?issue_url=<public GitHub issue URL>`
- Price: **$0.05 USDC per successful verdict**
- Payment: x402 v2, exact scheme
- Output: structured `AVOID`, `CAUTION`, or `VIABLE` verdict with score, signals, repository AI-contribution policy, coverage, limitations, and evidence URLs
- Discovery: x402 Bazaar extension with a strict input schema and realistic output example
- Failure behavior: invalid inputs, GitHub failures, and handler errors are not settled

`GET /` returns the product contract without payment. `GET /api/sample` returns a free representative result.

## Local verification

Use Node 22:

```bash
npm install
npm test
npm run typecheck
npm run deploy:dry
npm run dev -- --var PAY_TO_ADDRESS:0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001
```

An unpaid request should return HTTP 402 with `PAYMENT-REQUIRED`, including the $0.05 price and `extensions.bazaar` metadata:

```bash
curl -i 'http://127.0.0.1:8787/api/verdict?issue_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ftypeorm%2Ftypeorm%2Fissues%2F3357'
```

The buyer harness inspects the challenge without paying by default:

```bash
RESOURCE_SERVER_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8787 npm run payment:inspect
```

To execute a Base Sepolia payment, supply a funded **test-only** buyer key. The harness enforces a 50,000-atomic-unit ($0.05 USDC) cap and refuses Base mainnet unless `ALLOW_MAINNET_PAYMENT=YES` is explicitly set:

```bash
RESOURCE_SERVER_URL=https://your-test-worker.workers.dev \
BUYER_PRIVATE_KEY=0xTESTNET_ONLY \
npm run payment:smoke
```

## Deployment inputs

Only a **public EVM receiving address** is required from the owner for testnet. Never provide a seed phrase or private key to this service.

For production Bazaar discovery, configure:

- `PAY_TO_ADDRESS`: public Base-compatible wallet address receiving USDC
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: optional fine-grained read-only token for higher API capacity
- `CDP_API_KEY_ID` and `CDP_API_KEY_SECRET`: facilitator credentials stored as Worker secrets
- `X402_NETWORK=eip155:8453`
- `X402_FACILITATOR_URL=https://api.cdp.coinbase.com/platform/v2/x402`

The no-signup facilitator in the default config is Base Sepolia only. Its test catalog is separate from Coinbase's production Bazaar. A Bazaar-enabled resource is indexed after its first successful settlement through the CDP facilitator.

### Cloudflare compatibility note

The reference Hono integration auto-loads a Bazaar validator that uses runtime code generation, which Cloudflare Workers disallow. This Worker uses the same official `declareDiscoveryExtension()` output, adds the static HTTP method at build time, validates it in the test suite, and then attaches the finished declaration to the retained x402 route configuration after middleware construction. The resulting metadata passes both Bazaar protocol and schema validation tests and is sent unchanged in the x402 payment challenge without runtime eval.

## Production commands

After authenticating Wrangler:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put PAY_TO_ADDRESS --env production
npx wrangler secret put GITHUB_TOKEN --env production
npx wrangler secret put CDP_API_KEY_ID --env production
npx wrangler secret put CDP_API_KEY_SECRET --env production
npm run deploy -- --env production
```

The receiving address is public on-chain, but storing it as a binding keeps deployment configuration separate from source. The other three values are secrets and must never be committed.
