# BountyVerdict

[![CI](https://github.com/cristianmoroaica/bountyverdict/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cristianmoroaica/bountyverdict/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Know before you code.

BountyVerdict checks whether a public GitHub bounty issue is still worth investigating. It catches failure modes that shallow bounty boards miss:

- closed or locked issues;
- archived or stale repositories;
- linked open pull requests;
- closed-PR and attempt swarms;
- explicit maintainer rejection or spam warnings;
- comments indicating a withdrawn or cancelled reward.

Every important result links back to public GitHub evidence. The tool does not guarantee that a reward exists, that work will be merged, or that anyone will pay.

## Use it

Visit [BountyVerdict](https://cristianmoroaica.github.io/bountyverdict/) and paste a public GitHub issue URL.

No account, token, backend, analytics, or data storage is used. Your browser makes read-only requests directly to GitHub's public API.

## Agent API

The `agent/` directory contains the paid, machine-readable product surface. It is a Cloudflare Worker with two x402-protected products: a **$0.05 USDC** fresh verdict and a **$0.40 USDC** portfolio that ranks 2–10 candidates. Both declare strict input/output schemas through the Bazaar discovery extension. The paid checks also read official contribution documents for explicit AI-work bans or disclosure requirements.

Agents can inspect free single and portfolio samples, see exact prices in the HTTP 402 response, then independently decide whether to buy. Invalid inputs and upstream failures return an error without settlement. The public [`agent-manifest.json`](agent-manifest.json) is the authoritative activation record, and [`skills/preflight-github-bounties/SKILL.md`](skills/preflight-github-bounties/SKILL.md) provides a guarded purchase workflow for agent consumers.

See [`agent/README.md`](agent/README.md) for the protocol, local verification, and deployment configuration.

The launch price and differentiation are grounded in a live Bazaar comparison documented in [`docs/MARKET_VALIDATION.md`](docs/MARKET_VALIDATION.md). Agents and crawlers can read [`llms.txt`](llms.txt) before deciding whether the product is relevant.

## Run locally

```bash
npm run serve
```

Open `http://localhost:4174`.

## Test

```bash
npm test
```

## Method and limits

The score is deliberately conservative and deterministic. BountyVerdict currently reads up to 300 issue comments and the first and newest timeline pages. Very large threads may contain additional evidence it does not see. Anonymous GitHub API rate limits apply.

Treat a `VIABLE` verdict as permission to investigate further—not permission to start coding. Reproduce the issue, read contribution and AI-use policies, confirm reward terms and payout eligibility, and establish acceptance criteria first.
