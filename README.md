# BountyVerdict

[![CI](https://github.com/cristianmoroaica/bountyverdict/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cristianmoroaica/bountyverdict/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Know before you code.

BountyVerdict checks whether a public GitHub bounty issue is still worth investigating. It catches failure modes that shallow bounty boards miss:

- closed or locked issues;
- archived or stale repositories;
- linked open pull requests;
- closed-PR and attempt swarms;
- explicit maintainer rejection or spam warnings;
- comments indicating a withdrawn or cancelled reward.

Every important result links back to public GitHub evidence. The tool does not guarantee that a reward exists, that work will be merged, or that anyone will pay.

## Use it

Visit [BountyVerdict](https://cristianmoroaica.github.io/bountyverdict/) and paste a public GitHub issue URL.

No account, token, backend, analytics, or data storage is used. Your browser makes read-only requests directly to GitHub's public API.

## Agent API

The `agent/` directory contains the paid, machine-readable product surface. It is a Cloudflare Worker with seven x402-protected products: a **$0.05 USDC** fresh bounty verdict, a **$0.40 USDC** portfolio that ranks 2–10 candidates, a **$0.03 USDC HarnessVerdict** instruction audit, a **$0.06 USDC SkillVerdict** security audit, a **$0.04 USDC RunVerdict** diagnosis, a **$0.07 Base USDC FlakeVerdict** retry gate, and a **$0.02 USDC MCPDriftVerdict** compatibility and declared-security gate for complete MCP `tools/list` snapshots. All declare input/output schemas through the Bazaar discovery extension.

Agents can inspect free samples, see exact prices in the HTTP 402 response, then independently decide whether to buy. Invalid inputs and upstream failures return an error without settlement. The public [`agent-manifest.json`](agent-manifest.json) is the authoritative activation record. Guarded purchase workflows live under [`skills/`](skills/).

Install the umbrella router, which selects the right bounded check and loads its product-specific safeguards:

```bash
npx skills add cristianmoroaica/bountyverdict --skill route-github-agent-checks -y
```

Install every operating skill with `npx skills add cristianmoroaica/bountyverdict --skill '*' -y`. Each product entry in the manifest also publishes its direct `skill_url`, exact install command, and `use_when` trigger.

The established contracts were exercised end to end on Base Sepolia and Base mainnet. The production manifest is active and Coinbase Bazaar indexes five established resources; FlakeVerdict and MCPDriftVerdict remain explicitly pending until their first policy-bound catalog settlements. Owner-funded launch proofs are interoperability tests, not earned revenue, and are excluded from the revenue ledger.

HarnessVerdict pins the repository default branch to an immutable commit and audits recognized `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, Copilot, Cursor, and `SKILL.md` surfaces without cloning or executing repository code. It reports evidence-linked path, scope, portability, context-budget, skill-frontmatter, and secret-like-material findings.

SkillVerdict pins and statically scans a requested public skill directory without executing it. It combines high-confidence dangerous-pattern checks with repository context, capability disclosure, external-domain inventory, secret redaction, and explicit coverage to reduce both missed supply-chain hazards and naive false positives.

RunVerdict reads exact-attempt job metadata and bounded failed-job logs without executing or rerunning code. It separates primary failures from aggregate-result jobs, redacts secret-like excerpts, classifies root-cause families, and recommends whether to fix, investigate, wait, or retry.

FlakeVerdict compares a completed public GitHub Actions failure with other attempts of the same run, same-commit outcomes, and up to 12 earlier comparable workflow runs. It scans at most 8 selected failed-job logs and 4 MiB of log data, never executes repository code, and never triggers, reruns, cancels, approves, or otherwise mutates CI. Its six typed outcomes are `CONFIRMED_FLAKE`, `LIKELY_FLAKE`, `RECURRING_FAILURE`, `NEW_FAILURE`, `INCONCLUSIVE`, and `NOT_FAILED`; only a current `CONFIRMED_FLAKE` can recommend one retry.

Agents can inspect the [free FlakeVerdict sample](samples/flake.json) and use the guarded [classify-github-flakes skill](skills/classify-github-flakes/SKILL.md). Every successful result carries this reuse rule: call FlakeVerdict for every completed public GitHub Actions failure before spending a retry; reuse the result only for its exact run ID and attempt, and call again after a new attempt appears.

MCPDriftVerdict accepts two complete inline MCP 2025-11-25 `tools/list` snapshots, canonicalizes and hashes them, proves only a conservative JSON Schema 2020-12 compatibility subset, reverses variance for outputs, and flags tool removals, model-facing metadata changes, task-mode breaks, and declared safety-hint regressions. It validates and computes the whole verdict before x402 settlement and never connects to an MCP server, fetches catalog URLs, invokes tools, or follows catalog instructions. Agents can inspect the [free sample](samples/mcp-drift.json) and guarded [check-mcp-tool-drift skill](skills/check-mcp-tool-drift/SKILL.md).

See [`agent/README.md`](agent/README.md) for the protocol, local verification, and deployment configuration.

The launch price and differentiation are grounded in a live Bazaar comparison documented in [`docs/MARKET_VALIDATION.md`](docs/MARKET_VALIDATION.md). Agents and crawlers can read [`llms.txt`](llms.txt) before deciding whether the product is relevant.

## Run locally

```bash
npm run serve
```

Open `http://localhost:4174`.

## Test

```bash
npm test
```

## Method and limits

The score is deliberately conservative and deterministic. BountyVerdict currently reads up to 300 issue comments and the first and newest timeline pages. Very large threads may contain additional evidence it does not see. Anonymous GitHub API rate limits apply.

Treat a `VIABLE` verdict as permission to investigate further—not permission to start coding. Reproduce the issue, read contribution and AI-use policies, confirm reward terms and payout eligibility, and establish acceptance criteria first.
